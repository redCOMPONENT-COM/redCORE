Rapid Application Development library for redCOMPONENT extensions

The main aim of redCORE is to provide a mature and abstracted layer for development that will act as a base model for any future redCOMPONENT extension beeing developed.

There is no convention over configuration in redCORE, unlike its counterparts, because we need more complex structures and hierachy and to solve more complex problems in redCORE.

redCORE is a quicker and more uniform way of creating extensions while adding some very interesting libraries and features to Joomla.

redCORE is not a rapid application development tool based on conventions to automatically create output.

It is our hope that redCORE will be interesting for other Joomla developers or even the Joomla Core.
