## Add translation elements 

If you have created your XML files, then you need to install and enable them in your redCORE translation system

### Step 1
Go to `redCORE Translations`:

<img src="./assets/img/translation/01.png" class="example" />

### Step 2
Go to `Manage Translation tables`:

<img src="./assets/img/translation/25.png" class="example" />

### Step 3
Select your component to add translation to.  If your component is not listed, you can simply select `redCORE`:

<img src="./assets/img/translation/26.png" class="example" />

### Step 4
Choose the XML file and upload it using the upload button:

<img src="./assets/img/translation/27.png" class="example" />

### Step 5
Check your newly uploaded content element and install it:

<img src="./assets/img/translation/28.png" class="example" />


Now your element is ready to be translated as described in the [Create translation elements](chapters/translation/create-elements.md) section.
